          <h1> Crazy Chest Workouts for Major Growth </h1>
           <ul>
               <li> <b> Regular Pushups</b></li> <p>Arguably the best overall chest workout for calisthenics. Reps, and form are key.
                Change the variables by doing incline, and decline pushups.</p>
                <li> <b>Dips</b></li><p> My personal favorite. It gets your lower chest, the split in your chest, and also
                give the triceps a great pump too.</p>
                <li> <b>Diamond Pushups</b></li><p> Works the inner chest, triceps, and shoulders all at once, and gives
                a great pump.</p>
                <li> <b>Planche Pushup</b></li><p> Planche pushups? An unknown workout to most, but one of the most advanced in the 
                calisthenic work. It's a where you raise your legs, and do no leg pushups. Defintely the most difficult,
                as it challenges the whole body. </p>
